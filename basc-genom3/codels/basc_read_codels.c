/* --- getAudioData ----------------------------------------------------- */

/* This function takes samples from the structure pointed by src
   (input data from the server's port), and copies them at the
   locations pointed by destL and destR. Note that destL and destR
   should point to allocated memory.

   It copies N samples at most from each channel (left and right
   sequence members of *src), starting at the index *nfr (next frame
   to read).

   The return value n is the amount of samples that the function was
   actually able to get (n <= N).

   If loss is not NULL, the function stores the amount of frames that
   were lost in *loss (*loss equals 0 if no loss).
